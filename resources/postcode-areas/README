DG POSTCODE TOWN & COUNTIES DATABASE
===========================
The `DG POSTCODE TOWN & COUNTIES DATABASE` is a free to use, modify and distribute
data set containing data that associates postal "out codes" to towns, counties
and countries. It also contains eastings, northings, latitude and longitude
information.

Provided database formats (as of 0.5) include CSV, ODS, SQLite, MySQL, JSON and XML.

CHANGES
======

05/10/11
--------------
This update adds country ISO 3166-2:GB codes as well as country strings (names).
Also contains a few minor fixes and accuracy improvements.

Note: Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Mann use Alpha 2 codes from ISO 3166-1.

10/06/11
--------------
This update improves the accuracy of data within the existing database prior 
to plans of releasing a new database based on the governments Code Point 
Open dataset.

The data contained in this update is quite a drastic change in the fact that 
some towns are very specific (for example “Aberdeen Airport”) due to longitude 
and latitude being used to determine the address as opposed to the actual 
postcode itself. 

I decided to go down this route as some postcodes cover more than one major 
area. For this reason the county column will always be more accurate then the 
“town”. The next planned database uses fully formed postcodes so this won't 
be an issue.

*-  Latitude and Longitude has a higher precision to 5 decimal places
*-  Counties are more specific based on postal addresses and less ceremonial. For 
example “Aberdeenshire” might now have the county “Aberdeen City” depending 
on the location.
*- Includes some tools
*- Now includes an SQLite database (SL3)

08/10/10
--------------
This update contains 27 additional postcode entries thanks to Dennis Milns. 
The new entries are CB21-CB25, GY1-GY9, IM1-IM9, JE1-JE5. I've also included 
the Northing and Easting for these postcodes. Thanks Dennis!
	
*- Removed some odd spaces ' ' appearing for some county and town names
	

14/05/10
--------------
This update corrects mistakes, fixes the incorrect longitude/latitude problems 
and improves the resolution of counties. For example Birmingham now has 
the county "West Midlands" and not "Birmingham".
	
*- Corrected the Longitude/Latitude columns in the SQL file. The values were 
correct but the data type wasn't (doh)
*- Improved the duplicate "town/county" issue.
